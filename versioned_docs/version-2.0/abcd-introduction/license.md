## OPEN LICENSE AND Source (foss)

ABCD follows free and open source software philosophy (foss - free and open source software), a tradition that inherits from the long history of the Isis software family.

### From "Free" to "open"

Since its early versions distributed by UNESCO in 1985, ISIS software has always been "free" (free), ie available at no cost to the non-commercial sector.However, even before the movement foss became popular, Isis was already "open" in many important aspects:

1. **Open and published standards:** Technical manuals detail the internal operation of the system, allowing other developers to create their own compatible versions and tools.
2. **Open and customizable interface:** Menus structure and software messaging system were completely editable, allowing users to adapt the interface and even system functionality.
3. **Integrated programming tool:** ISIS/PASCAL functioned as an application programming interface (API), allowing the creation of routines and complex programs that expanded native software capabilities.
4. **Formatting Language (FL):** A powerful language that allowed the librarians themselves, without in -depth knowledge of programming, controlling in detail how the data would be processed and displayed, from screen to printed reports.

### The commitment to the open source

In 2008, at the 3rd Isis World Congress, the user community formally decided that ISIS would become totally foss software, coordinated by an international coordination committee.

Following this commitment, ABCD is developed and distributed as an open source project.This means that users have the freedom to use, study, modify and distribute the software.The advantage is that qualified programmers and users can verify internal mechanisms, propose improvements and adapt the system to their specific needs, ensuring their longevity and continuous evolution.

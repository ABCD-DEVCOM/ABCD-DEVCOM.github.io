# Comments
It is a very good idea when writing IsisScripts to include explanations of what is happening.\\ 
This helps anyone else trying to understand your scripts – and you when you come back to a script you wrote six months ago.

Comments are written within the tag `<!-- -->`, for example:

```xml

<!-- Write the document header -->
<display><pft>’Content-type: text/html’##</pft></display>

```

Such comments are ignored by WWWISIS – they are only for human consumption!

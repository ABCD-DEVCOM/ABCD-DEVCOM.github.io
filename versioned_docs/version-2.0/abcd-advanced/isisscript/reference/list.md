# Element `<list>`

The `<list>` element modifies IsisScript's internal list object. The available options are to add items to the list or to delete all items currently in the list.

## Usage
- **Allowed content:** `<pft>`
- **Parent elements:** `<do>`, `<function>`, `<hl>`, `<loop>`, `<section>`, `<update>`

## Syntax

```xml
<list action="..." [type="..."]>
    </list>

```

## Attributes

| Attribute | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **`action`** | **Required.** Indicates the action to be executed on the list (`load`, `delete`). |
| `type` | Indicates the storage type/behavior of the list (`freq`, `list`, `sort`). |

---

## Action Details

### `action="load"`

Adds new items to the list based on the content provided.

* **Content:** Each line generated by the content (PFT) is treated as a new item.

### `action="delete"`

Deletes all items from the list (clears it).

* **Content:** Typically ignored or set to a dummy value like `now`.

---

## Type Details

The `type` attribute defines how the data is stored when `action="load"`.

### `type="list"` (Default)

Standard list storage. Items are added sequentially as they appear.

```xml
<list action="load" type="list"><pft>(v66/)</pft></list>

```

### `type="sort"`

Sorted list. Indicates that the list is sorted by the item value as data is loaded.

```xml
<list action="load" type="sort"><pft>(v66/)</pft></list>

```

### `type="freq"`

Frequency counting list.

* Instead of adding a repeated item as a new entry, **the counter for that item is incremented**.
* This is used to generate histograms or frequency distributions (e.g., counting how many times each keyword appears).

```xml
<list action="load" type="freq"><pft>(v66/)</pft></list>

```

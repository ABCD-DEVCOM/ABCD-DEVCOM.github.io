# Circulation Administration

Beyond the daily transactions of loaning and returning items, the Circulation module has a dedicated **Administration** section for oversight, reporting, and managing the operational health of the lending service.

These tools provide librarians with the ability to generate reports, track daily activity, and manage user accounts and penalties.

### Key Administrative Functions

1.  **Daily Journal and Reports:**
    * The system maintains a **daily journal** that logs all circulation activities. Administrators can view this journal to track the transactions performed on any given day.
    * A variety of **statistical and operational reports** can be generated, including:
        * Lists of overdue items.
        * Lists of active loans.
        * User statistics and borrowing histories.
        * Inventories of loanable objects.

2.  **Printing Receipts and Notices:**
    * The module can generate and print various types of notices and receipts for users.
    * This includes overdue notices to be sent to users, loan receipts, and account statements. The layout and content of these documents can be customized using PFTs.

3.  **Managing Suspensions and Fines:**
    * When a user incurs a fine or a suspension (as determined by the Loan Policy), the details are recorded in the `suspensions` database.
    * From the administration menu, staff can view and manage these sanctions. This includes viewing a list of all suspended users, checking the value of outstanding fines, and clearing penalties once they have been resolved.

4.  **Calendar of Holidays:**
    * Administrators can configure a calendar of holidays and non-working days.
    * The system will automatically take this calendar into account when calculating loan due dates, ensuring that items are not due on a day when the library is closed.

These administrative tools are crucial for maintaining the efficiency and fairness of the library's circulation services.

# BVS Site: Site Administration

The BVS Site module, also known as ABCD Site, is a complete Content Management System (CMS) designed to create and manage the library's public-facing website or portal. While modules like iAH and OPAC provide the search functionality, the BVS Site builds the entire user-facing experience around them, allowing you to add menus, static pages, news, banners, and other content.

This creates a comprehensive and professional portal for your library's users.

### Accessing the Site Administration Panel

The entire configuration of the BVS Site is done through a web-based administration panel.

* **URL:** `http://your-server/site/admin`
* **Default User:** `adm`
* **Default Password:** `x`

> **Security Warning:** It is critical to change the default password immediately after installation.

### The Administration Interface

The administration panel is divided into several key areas, allowing you to manage different aspects of the site's content and appearance. The main menu sections include:

* **Structure:** This is where you configure the fundamental elements of your site's identity.
    * **Logo:** Upload your institution's logo.
    * **Identification:** Set the name and title of the site that appear in the header.
    * **Contact:** Edit the contact information displayed in the site's footer.
    * **Menus:** Create and manage the main navigation menus of your portal.

* **Components:** Components are the building blocks of your site's pages. This section allows you to manage the different types of content that can be displayed, such as text blocks, image galleries, and search forms.

* **Access:** This area is for managing the user accounts that have permission to administer the BVS Site. Here you can add new administrators or change existing passwords.

The following page will detail how to manage the site's structure and content in more detail.

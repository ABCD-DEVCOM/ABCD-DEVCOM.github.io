# BVS Site: Managing Components and Content

The content and layout of the BVS Site are managed using a flexible, block-based system. Each piece of content on your site—whether it's a block of text, a news feed, a menu, or a search form—is treated as a **Component**. Administrators build pages by adding and arranging these components within the site's structure.

This component-based architecture allows for the easy reuse of content and provides a simple way to manage complex page layouts.

### How Content is Structured

The process of managing content is done through the **Structure** menu in the site's administration panel.

1.  The administrator navigates to the page or section of the site they wish to edit.
2.  The page is divided into predefined areas (e.g., Header, Left Column, Main Content Area, Footer).
3.  Within each area, the administrator can see a list of the components that are currently active.
4.  From here, they can:
    * **Add a new Component:** Select from a list of available component types to add a new content block to that area.
    * **Reorder Components:** Use up and down arrows to change the order in which components appear.
    * **Edit or Delete a Component:** Modify the content of an existing component or remove it from the page.

### Common Component Types

The BVS Site comes with a variety of pre-built component types to handle different kinds of content, including:

* **Title and Text:** A general-purpose component for adding static content using a WYSIWYG editor.
* **News List:** Automatically displays a list of the latest news items.
* **Search Form:** Embeds the iAH or OPAC search interface directly onto a page.
* **Menu:** Displays a navigation menu that you can define in the Structure section.
* **Image Gallery or Banner:** For displaying single images or carousels.

By combining these components, an administrator can build rich, dynamic, and informative pages for the library's portal without needing to write any code.

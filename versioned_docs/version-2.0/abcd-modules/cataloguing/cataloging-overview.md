# Cataloging Overview

The Cataloging module is the heart of the ABCD suite, where bibliographic records are created, searched, edited, and managed. Due to its flexibility, inherited from the underlying CDS/ISIS technology, ABCD can handle virtually any bibliographic standard or format, such as MARC, LILACS, AGRIS, or custom-defined structures.

This module provides a comprehensive set of tools for the entire cataloging workflow, accessible through its main menu in the Central module. Key functionalities include:

* **Database Structure Definition:** You have full control to define or modify the structure of your databases, including the Field Definition Table (FDT), data entry worksheets (FMT), indexing rules (FST), and display formats (PFT).
* **Data Entry:** Create new records from scratch using web-based data entry forms that can be customized with picklists, authority control, and validation rules.
* **Search and Retrieval:** Perform advanced searches on your bibliographic data and browse alphabetical indexes (dictionaries) to find records quickly.
* **Record Management:** A complete set of tools to manage records, including editing, copying, and deleting.
* **Utilities:** Access a wide range of database maintenance tools, such as:
    * Importing and exporting records in ISO 2709 format.
    * Performing global changes across multiple records.
    * Managing the inverted file (index).
* **Cooperative Cataloging:** Use the integrated Z39.50 client to search and import records from external library catalogs.

The following pages will delve into the details of each of these functions, starting with the fundamental concepts of the database structure (FDT and FST).

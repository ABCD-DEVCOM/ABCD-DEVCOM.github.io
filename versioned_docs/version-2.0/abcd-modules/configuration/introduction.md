# System Configuration Overview

The **Configuration** menu, located within the ABCD Central module's Administration area, is the heart of the system's customization. From here, you can control nearly every aspect of the software's behavior, appearance, and functionality.

A correct configuration is crucial for adapting ABCD to the specific workflows of your institution, ensuring security, and providing a user-friendly experience for both operators and library patrons.

This section is divided into three main areas:

1.  **Operators and Access Profiles:** Learn how to create user accounts, define access profiles with specific permissions (e.g., cataloger, circulation assistant), and manage system security.

2.  **Appearance and Languages:** Customize the visual identity of your ABCD instance with your institution's logos and colors, and manage the languages available in the interface.

3.  **Database Management (`bases.dat`):** Understand how to manage the list of databases available in the Central module, including adding new databases or changing their display order.

Proceed to the following pages to explore each of these areas in detail.

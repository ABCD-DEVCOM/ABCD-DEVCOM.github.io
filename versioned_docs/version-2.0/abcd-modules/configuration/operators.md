# Operators and Access Profiles

A crucial step in configuring your ABCD instance is setting up user accounts (**Operators**) and defining their permissions through **Access Profiles**. This ensures that each team member has the appropriate level of access to perform their duties from the very beginning.

The general process involves first creating profiles based on the different roles in your library (e.g., "Cataloger," "Circulation Desk") and then creating individual operator accounts that are assigned to these roles.

For a complete, step-by-step guide on how to create, edit, and manage both operators and access profiles, please refer to the definitive documentation in the System Administration section. This will be your single source of truth for user management.

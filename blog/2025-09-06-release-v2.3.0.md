Note that Z3950 requires the YAZ extension for PHP. YAZ is not available for every PHP version.
### Upgrading
Upgrading to this version depends heavily on your current version.
It is recommended to read the standard upgrade instructions in
[https://github.com/ABCD-DEVCOM/ABCD/blob/master/zz_installation/upgrade_instructions.md](upgrade_instructions.md)
Check the configuration files of your databases with the corresponding upgraded example databases.

The new Upgrade tool is still in the development phase: Will become available in a next release.
If you use it now: _Take sufficient precautions (e.g. backups). Data loss and/or code mismatches may occur by using it now._

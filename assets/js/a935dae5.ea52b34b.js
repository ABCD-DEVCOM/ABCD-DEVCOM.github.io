Therefore we prefer to call ISIS a 'documentary database' in which documents are stored as a record with variable structure and length. This avoids complicated structures of 'normalized' relational structures, which are very efficient in storing highly structured data but less so for semi-structured textual data."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This means that the records themselves can be quite polymorph, meaning structurally different with any combi- nations of fields. In principle ISIS can handle bibliographic records along with user-data and transactional data (e.g. loans) in one single database, but because of 'semi-relational' capabilities (fast retrieval of any part of a record in any ISIS-database at run-time, i.e. by the Formatting Language creating the output without the need for these 'relations' to be pre-defined) typically ISIS-applications will use some few databases, e.g. in ABCD only 3 or 4 databases (one for bibliographic entities, one for users, one for transactions and possibly one for items) can allow to run a full library."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In the 'classic' ISIS technology 1all variable-length records (with (sub-)fields containing the values) are stored in a 'Master' file (.MST) and record-positions are kept track of in the 'Cross-Reference' (.XRF) file, which can be seen as a 'first-order' normal index on the records in the database. New or even just edited records are always appended at the end of the Master file and references in the XRF are updated accordingly, necessitating some 'compacting' at times to get rid of deleted and/or inactive (versions of) records.2 All values specified by a 'Field Selection Table' (which uses the Formatting language, therefore allowing very flexible and powerful definition of selected elements), are included into a B-tree 'Inverted File', which can be seen as a 'dictionary' of terms with the exact 'address' (record, fieldtag, occurrence, position within occurrence) attached to them. This allows very efficient retrieval, including full-text based, of any element defined as being 'retrievable'. ISIS was one of the first databases to offer full-text, which became only popular decades later. This 'Inverted File' (or IF) has several components (with nodes .N01/.N02 and leaves .L01/L02 files) for efficient organization - because in certain applications with intensive indexing the IF can be even larger than the database file itself ! So typically ISIS-databases exist of some 10 files : a MST with XRF, the B-Tree Inverted File files and some definition tables for the fields, the data-entry form and the indexation. Due to the memory types used in the 'XRF'-file, which is a fixed-format table acting as a list of all MFNs with their ID and location into the MST, the maximum number of records which can be hold in one ISIS-database is slightly over 16 million. On the other hand within this limit the software performs remarkably well without almost any noticeable performance loss at higher numbers. All this is changing with the new database technologies introduced in 2009 with e.g. J-ISIS : Berkeley DB uses a different storage in separate files with the definitions incorporated into the main data-files. But basically the concept of 'tag-value' pairs (an identifier and a content), on which a powerful Formatting Language and fieldbased plus full-text indexing is applied, remain the core of ISIS-databases."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"cisis---utility-programs",children:"CISIS - Utility Programs"}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"CISIS - Utility Programs is a set of software developed by BIREME to handle ISIS databases from the Command Line in UNIX/Linux or DOS/Windows.

In the case of an existing Apache webserver, expertise on Apache should be available in order to integrate ABCD with the existing Apache-based applications. E.g. a virtual server for ABCD could be set up with 'aliases' specifically for the ABCD system (htdocs home) and cgi (scripts folder). In the case of the full package, as it came for ABCD 1.x, the latest 'stable' Apache httpd-version was included, pre-configured to work with ABCD as 'localhost' (which means : the PC itself runs both the client and the server). A small script launched the httpd (or Apache) service based on that configuration, so that installation and configuration efforts in principle could be kept to a strict minimum. Since nowadays too many different versions (32/64 bits, thread-safe or non-safe, MS VC10,12,14...) exist we think it is better to leave the installation of Apache and PHP to specialized packages such as the above mentioned WAMP and XAMP or, in the case of Linux, the 'server-versions' of the Linux-distributions which come with their own Apache and PHP pre-installed.

These typically have slightly different needs, e.g. have more specialized collections, higher needs re contents disclosure (e.g. by providing abstracts, using thesauri etc.) and requiring more flexibility in the bibliographic structures. For this reason ABCD not only has tried to include full-text features but was principally conceived to offer a very open solution, allowing any fields structure to be created and maintained within the same software. By the database technology of ISIS itself, which is quite flexible and non-restrictive, bibliographic structures can be created without a need to 'normalise' all elements into a series of tables or relations (as is the case with relational database technology) and in most cases all bibliographic elements can be contained into one single database - only for optimization purposes ISIS would expect some semi-relational approaches to be implemented."}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"As a library system, however, ABCD comes pre-configured for some major bibliographic standards, i.e. MARC21, CEPAL and AGRIS.

Each entity subsequently can be thoroughly 'moulded' by the librarians themselves with the use of the ISIS Formatting Language (FL), which allows dealing with all elements of an entity (e.g. a substring from a subfield of an occurrence of one specific field at micro-detail level) without real programming - even if the FL allows some degree of programming logics like loops and nested conditions - for the creation of any output format. This output can be anything like a sort key, an indexing key, a screen format or - as is the case in e.g. ABCD - ISIS-data embedded in web-pages or any other grammar such as XML.

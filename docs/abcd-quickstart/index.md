# Creating your First Catalog

In ABCD, a "Catalog" or "Database" is not just a table in a database server; it is a collection of definitions (fields, input forms, display formats) and data files managed by the CISIS engine.

To start working with ABCD, you need at least one database. There are three main ways to create one:

1.  **Use a Standard Model (Recommended):** Duplicate an existing standard (like MARC 21 or Dublin Core) and start working immediately.
2.  **Create from Scratch:** Define every field, indexing rule, and display format manually. This gives you total control but requires advanced knowledge of the ISIS family.
3.  **Import from WinISIS:** If you are migrating legacy data, ABCD can convert your old DOS/Windows databases directly.

## Which method should I choose?

| Method | Best for... | Difficulty |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[From Model](./abcd-quickstart/create-from-model)** | **Beginners.** Libraries that want to follow standards (MARC, LILACS) without hassle. | ⭐ |
| **[From Scratch](./advanced-creation#option-2-create-from-scratch)** | **Experts.** Archives or special collections with unique metadata needs. | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **[WinISIS Import](./advanced-creation#option-3-import-from-winisis)** | **Migrators.** Institutions upgrading from CDS/ISIS or WinISIS. | ⭐⭐ |

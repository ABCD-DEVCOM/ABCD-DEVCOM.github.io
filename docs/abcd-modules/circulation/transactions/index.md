# Circulation Desk Operations

The **Transactions** menu is the operational hub of the Circulation module. This is where staff interact with patrons to perform loans, returns, renewals, and fine payments.

**Access:** **Circulation > Transactions**

## The Interface

The Transactions screen is divided into three logical areas:

1.  **User Identification (Top/Left)**: A search bar to find the patron by ID (Barcode) or Name.
2.  **Current Status (Center)**: Once a user is selected, this area displays:
    * **Active Loans**: Items currently in possession of the user.
    * **Suspensions/Fines**: Red alerts if the user is blocked.
    * **User Info**: Category (Student, Teacher) which determines their lending policy.
3.  **Action Toolbar**: Buttons to execute specific tasks (Loan, Return, Renew, Reserve, Statement).

## Basic Workflow

Most interactions follow this pattern:
1.  **Identify the User**: Scan their ID card or type their name.
2.  **Verify Status**: Check if the screen background turns **Red** (Blocked) or stays **White** (Active).
3.  **Perform Action**: Click the desired button (e.g., Loan) and scan the Item Barcode.

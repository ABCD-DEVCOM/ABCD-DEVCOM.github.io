# Cataloguing Module

The **Cataloguing Module** is the heart of the library's data management. It allows for the creation, modification, and retrieval of bibliographic records, as well as the management of authority files and copies.

This documentation is divided into three main sections depending on your role:

## 1. Librarian's Manual (Daily Tasks)
If you need to catalog books, search for records, or print labels, start here.
* **[Data Entry](manual/data-entry.md)**: Creating and editing records.
* **[Searching](manual/searching.md)**: Retrieving information.
* **[Z39.50 Copy Cataloging](manual/z3950.md)**: Downloading records from other libraries.

## 2. Database Configuration (Technical)
If you are setting up the database structure or modifying fields.
* **[Database Structure](configuration/structure.md)**: Understanding FDT, FST, and PFT.
* **[Worksheets](configuration/worksheets.md)**: Designing data entry forms.
* **[Validation](configuration/validation.md)**: Setting rules for data quality.

## 3. Utilities & Tools
* **[Import & Export](utilities/import-export.md)**: Moving data via ISO 2709.
* **[Global Changes](utilities/global-changes.md)**: Batch editing of records.

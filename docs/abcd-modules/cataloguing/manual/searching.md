# Search and Retrieval

ABCD provides two primary methods for finding records within the Cataloging module.

## 1. Dictionary Search (Browse)
Access: **Toolbar > Dictionary Icon (A-Z)**

This method allows you to browse the **Inverted File** (Index). It is the most precise way to find records because you see exactly what is indexed.
* Select a prefix (e.g., `TI_` for Titles, `AU_` for Authors).
* Type the first few letters.
* The system displays the index list. Select one or more terms to retrieve the records.

## 2. Advanced Search
Access: **Toolbar > Search Icon (Magnifying Glass)**

This allows for Boolean searching (AND, OR, NOT).
1.  **Field:** Select the field to search (Title, Author, Subject).
2.  **Expression:** Type your search term.
3.  **Operator:** Connect multiple lines with Boolean operators.

*Example:* `Title: History` **AND** `Author: Smith`

## Search History
ABCD maintains a session-based history of your searches. You can click on the **History** icon to recall previous result sets without re-typing the query.

# Cooperative Cataloging (Z39.50)

Z39.50 is an international standard client-server protocol that allows searching and retrieving information from remote library databases. ABCD includes a built-in Z39.50 client, which is a powerful tool for **copy cataloging**. Instead of creating a new bibliographic record from scratch, catalogers can search for the item in a large external catalog (like the Library of Congress), and if a record is found, import it directly into the local database.

This process significantly speeds up the cataloging workflow and improves the quality and standardization of the records.

### Configuring Z39.50 Servers

Before you can use the client, a system administrator must configure the connection details for the remote Z39.50 servers you want to access.

1.  This configuration is managed in a file named **`z3950.def`**, located in the `par` folder of your database (e.g., `/var/opt/ABCD/bases/your_db/par/`).
2.  For each remote server, you need to provide connection details such as:
    * A descriptive name (e.g., `Library of Congress`).
    * The server's host address and port.
    * The name of the database to be searched on the remote server.
    * The record syntax used (e.g., MARC21, UNIMARC).

### Using the Z39.50 Client in the Cataloging Workflow

Once the servers are configured, any cataloger can use the client.

1.  From the main menu of the Cataloging module, select the **Z39.50** option.
2.  A search form will appear. First, select the desired **remote server** from the dropdown list of configured targets.
3.  Enter your search terms. Searching by **ISBN** is often the most effective way to find a specific edition of a book. You can also search by title, author, or other criteria.
4.  Click **Search**. ABCD will connect to the remote server and display a list of matching records.
5.  You can view the full details of each record.
6.  When you find the correct record, select it and click the **Import** button. The record's data will be copied and saved as a new record in your local ABCD database, ready for any local modifications (like adding an inventory number).

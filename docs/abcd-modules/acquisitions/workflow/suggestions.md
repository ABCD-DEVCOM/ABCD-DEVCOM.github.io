# Managing Suggestions

The acquisition process typically begins with a **Suggestion**. This allows the library to build a "Wishlist" based on community needs before committing budget.

## 1. Creating a Suggestion
**Access:** **Acquisitions > Suggestions > New**

Librarians can manually enter suggestions. (Note: If configured, OPAC users can also send suggestions remotely).
* **Bibliographic Data:** Enter Title, Author, and Publisher.
* **Recommender:** Who asked for this? (Student, Professor, Department).
* **Quantity:** How many copies are requested.

## 2. Status Management
**Access:** **Acquisitions > Suggestions > Status**

This is the control tower for the Acquisitions Librarian. The interface lists all pending items.
* **Approve:** Moves the item to the "Bidding/Decision" phase.
* **Reject:** Archives the request (usually requires entering a reason code).
* **Pending:** Keeps it in the list for future review.

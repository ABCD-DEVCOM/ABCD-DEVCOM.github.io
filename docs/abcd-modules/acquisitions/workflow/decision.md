# Bidding and Decision

Before generating a Purchase Order, approved suggestions often need to be vetted against budget availability and vendor prices.

## 1. Bidding (Quotes)
**Access:** **Acquisitions > Bidding**

This function allows you to record price quotes from different providers for approved suggestions.
* Select the items.
* Enter the price quoted by different vendors.
* This helps in selecting the best offer.

## 2. The Decision Module
**Access:** **Acquisitions > Decision**

This is the final filter before a financial commitment is made.
1.  **Select Items:** View all "Approved" suggestions.
2.  **Assign Provider:** Link the item to a specific vendor (`providers` database).
3.  **Approve for Purchase:** Mark the item as ready for ordering.
    * *System Action:* This changes the status internal flag, making the item visible to the "Purchase Order" module.

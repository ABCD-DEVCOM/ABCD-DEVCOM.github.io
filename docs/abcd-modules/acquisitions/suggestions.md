# Suggestions

The **Suggestions** stage is the initial phase of the acquisitions workflow, where all requests for new materials are formally registered and evaluated. This structured process ensures that all purchase requests are tracked, reviewed, and either approved for purchase or formally rejected.

### The Suggestion Lifecycle

A suggestion moves through several statuses as it is processed by the library staff:

1.  **Creation:** A new suggestion is entered into the system with all the necessary details.
2.  **Evaluation:** The acquisitions librarian reviews the suggestion, checks for duplicates in the existing catalog, and verifies the bibliographic and pricing information.
3.  **Decision:** The suggestion is either **approved** or **rejected**.
4.  **Processing:** If approved, the suggestion is then forwarded to the next stage to be included in a purchase order.

### Creating a New Suggestion

Library staff can create new suggestions on behalf of users or for collection development purposes.

1.  Navigate to the **Acquisitions** module and select the **Suggestions** menu.
2.  Click on **New Suggestion**.
3.  Fill in the form with as much detail as possible:
    * **Bibliographic Information:** Title, author, ISBN, publisher, publication year.
    * **Requestor Information:** Name of the person or department requesting the item.
    * **Acquisition Details:** Estimated price, currency, and a justification for the purchase.
4.  Save the record. The suggestion is now in the system with a "Pending" status.

### Evaluating and Approving Suggestions

The acquisitions librarian is responsible for reviewing all pending suggestions.

1.  From the Suggestions menu, view the list of pending requests.
2.  For each suggestion, the librarian can perform several actions:
    * **Edit:** Add or correct any information in the suggestion record.
    * **Check for Duplicates:** Search the library's main catalog to see if the item is already owned.
    * **Make a Decision:** Change the status of the suggestion to **Approved** or **Rejected**.

Once a suggestion is approved, it becomes available to be added to a **Purchase Order**, which is the next step in the acquisitions process.

# Searching and Retrieving Records

ABCD offers multiple ways to find information, ranging from simple keyword lookups to complex boolean queries.

## 1. Types of Search

### Simple Search (Free Text)
Located on the homepage. Just type a word (e.g., "History") and press Enter.
* The system searches in all indexed fields (Title, Author, Subject).
* **Integrated Search:** If "All Databases" is selected, the system queries every available catalog simultaneously and presents a combined result list.

### Advanced Search
Click on **Advanced Search** to open a form with specific fields.
* **Boolean Operators:** Combine terms using `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`.
* **Field Specific:** Search specifically for "Author: Smith" AND "Title: Economics".
* **Filters:** Limit by language, year, or material type before searching.

## 2. The Result List
After searching, you see a list of records.

### Refine with Facets
On the side of the results, you will see the **Facets** panel. This is a dynamic filter system.
* Click on an **Author** to see only books by that person.
* Click on a **Year** to filter by publication date.
* *Note:* You can combine multiple facets to narrow down your results.

### Record Actions
For each item in the list, you can:
* **View Details:** Click the title to see the full bibliographic record.
* **Export:** Use the toolbar to export the citation to Word, Excel, or RIS (EndNote/Zotero).
* **Reserve:** If the item is currently on loan (and you are logged in), a **Reserve** button will appear.

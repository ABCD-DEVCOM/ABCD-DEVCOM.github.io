# Using the ABCD Public Catalog (OPAC)

The Online Public Access Catalog (OPAC) is your gateway to the library's collection. It allows you to search for books, access digital documents, and manage your personal account.

## The Interface
The OPAC homepage is designed for quick access:

* **Top Bar:** Contains the language selector and the **Sign In** button for "My Account".
* **Search Bar:** A central "Google-style" box for quick queries.
* **Database Selector:** Allows you to search across **All Databases** (Integrated Search) or select a specific catalog (e.g., only "Theses").
* **News & Links:** Information about the library, new acquisitions, or external links (configured by the library staff).

## Navigation
Use the sidebar or the top menu to access special sections like:
* **Advanced Search:** For precise filtering.
* **Help Pages:** User guides provided by the library.
* **External Resources:** Links to other institutions.

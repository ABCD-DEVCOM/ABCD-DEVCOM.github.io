# Historical Release Timeline

> **Document scope**
> This file serves four complementary purposes:
>
> 1. **Official historical record** of ABCD development
> 2. **Source for reusable milestones** in documentation
> 3. **Executive (summarized) timeline** for presentations and overviews
> 4. **Reference document** aligned with open‑source community standards
>
> Early releases predate modern version control and therefore contain partial or reconstructed information.

# About ABCD

## What is ABCD?

**ABCD** stands for **A**utomatisación de **B**ibliotécas y **C**entros de **D**ocumentación (Spanish). The acronym remains valid for other languages such as French (*Automation des Bibliothèques et Centres de Documentation*) and Portuguese (**A**utomatização das **B**ibliotecas e dos **C**entros de **D**ocumentação).

The name itself expresses the ambition of the software suite: to provide automation functions not only for classic libraries but also for other information providers like documentation centres, archives, and museums.

ABCD is a web-based integrated library management tool covering all main functions:
* **Acquisitions** and budget management;
* **Cataloging** and database management;
* **Circulation** (Loans and Users management);
* **OPAC** (Online Public Access Catalog) with integrated CMS features for library portals.

## Objectives and Philosophy

ABCD aims at providing **information professionals**—especially in developing countries—with a powerful tool that takes specific realities into account.

### 1. A Generic and Flexible Tool
Unlike systems designed solely for libraries with standard workflows, ABCD caters to documentation centres which often have distinct needs, such as specialized collections, complex content disclosure (abstracts, thesauri), and unique bibliographic structures.

* **Open Structure:** Thanks to the [ISIS technology](https://web.archive.org/web/20200710070324/https://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/information-society/open-source-and-low-cost-technologies/information-processing-tools/cdsisis-database-software/), bibliographic structures can be created without the need to "normalize" data into complex relational tables. In most cases, all bibliographic elements are contained in a single record file.
* **Independence:** The software allows users to manage or create *any* bibliographic structure (FDT). Non-bibliographic structures can also be created, provided the information is mainly textual.
* **Formatting Language:** **Information professionals** can control the output (display formats, sort keys, indexes) using the ISIS Formatting Language (PFT) without needing advanced programming skills.

### 2. Built for Low-Resource Contexts
The development of ABCD specifically addressed challenges common in many regions:
* **ICT Skills:** The system avoids unnecessary software architectural complexity, empowering **information professionals** to manage the system locally.
* **Connectivity:** By using modern web techniques (AJAX, JavaScript), data traffic between client and server is minimized. The local computer processes as much data as possible, reducing the dependency on high-bandwidth connections. The graphical design is kept clean and lightweight for this same reason.

## History and Governance

ABCD is developed and maintained as Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS).

### Origins and Evolution
ABCD was initially developed by [BIREME](https://web.archive.org/web/20210509162720/https://wiki.bireme.org/en/index.php/ABCD) (PAHO/WHO) with the support of the Flemish Interuniversity Council ([VLIR/UOS](https://www.vliruos.be)). BIREME led the development until **2016**.

Since 2016, the project is fully managed and developed by the **ABCD Community**, a group of developers and information professionals primarily based in Brazil and the Netherlands. This transition ensures the software remains community-driven, focusing on the real needs of its users.

### Technology
The software relies on the UNESCO-supported ISIS technology. A good understanding of basic ISIS concepts is crucial for fully mastering ABCD. It represents the modernization of a long history of ISIS-based web tools, succeeding projects like **Open MarcoPolo**, **Clabel**, and **WEBLIS**.

The current status of the project, source code, and release notes can be found on our [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/ABCD-DEVCOM).

# History and Partners

## The ISIS Family
ABCD belongs to the ISIS family of technologies. It utilizes the **CISIS** formatting language and database structure, ensuring compatibility with a long lineage of information management tools supported by UNESCO.

The software represents the evolution of library automation in this ecosystem, succeeding projects such as:
* **CDS/ISIS** (DOS/Windows)
* **WinISIS**
* **GenISIS**
* **Open MarcoPolo**
* **WEBLIS**

## Origins and Institutional Partners

The creation of ABCD was made possible through international cooperation involving key institutions in the field of information science.

### BIREME (PAHO/WHO)
The Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (**BIREME**) led the technological development of ABCD versions 1.0 and 2.0. BIREME's expertise in creating the **Virtual Health Library (VHL)** and its web-based tools (like iAH) formed the core of the ABCD architecture.

### VLIR/UOS
The **Flemish Interuniversity Council (VLIR/UOS)** from Belgium provided the main funding and strategic framework for the project. The initiative was born from the "DOCBIB" project, aiming to provide a modern automation solution for university libraries in partner countries.

### The ABCD Community
Since **2016**, the maintenance and evolution of the software have been managed by the **ABCD Community**. This group consists of independent developers, librarians, and institutions from countries including Brazil, the Netherlands, and others, ensuring the software remains open and updated.

## Acknowledgements
We acknowledge the contribution of the many developers, testers, and librarians who have participated in the project since its inception in 2008.
